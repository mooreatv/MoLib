ChangeLog

3.0.0 June 6th 2019
	- Created MoLib for common code between WhoTracker, Camera, DynamicBoxer etc

2.1.6 June 4th 2019
	- Bug fix for older LibWho: use the old/original "Level" instead of the new "level" field
2.1.5 June 4th 2019
	- Much cleaner initialization/code
	- Use a ticker (timer) instead of expensive OnUpdate for periodic query
	- if LibWho-2.0 (WhoLib) is installed, use it (though the functionality isn't 100% same)
	- internal Dump() debugging utility
2.1.4 May 26th 2019
	- Fix for wow classic (hopefully, despite no beta access to test... help needed!)
	- LUA reformat, removing unecessary ; etc
	- use new C_FriendList.* who APIs
	- interact fine when LibWho-2.0 is installed: don't pop up the Who window (unless it's up)
	- Better structure of the whoTrackerSaved saved variable. If you wrote code to parse it, it will need change!
	- /wt debug on persists through reload/restart (/wt debug off to turn off) - also turns on WhoLib debug if it is present.
	- redo release/tag to trigger auto build for curse - try #4 with pkgmeta.yaml
